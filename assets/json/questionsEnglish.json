        "type":"is-css",
        "answer":"The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a 'namespace' for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style."

        "mode":"intermediate",
        "type":"is-js",
        "answer":"Synchronous means each operation must wait for the previous one to complete. Asynchronous means an operation can occur while another operation is still being processed. In JavaScript, all code is synchronous due to the single-threaded nature of it. However, asynchronous operations not part of the program (such as XMLHttpRequest or setTimeout) are processed outside of the main thread because they are controlled by native code (browser APIs), but callbacks part of the program will still be executed synchronously."
